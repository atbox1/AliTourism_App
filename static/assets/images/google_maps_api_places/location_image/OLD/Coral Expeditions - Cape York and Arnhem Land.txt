<p>Recognised as Australia’s longest established and most awarded expedition cruise operator, Coral Expeditions are Australia’s pioneering cruise line offering a unique style of immersive expedition adventures in small ships purpose-built to take guests closer to nature and cultures. </p><p>Starting with environmentally-sensitive cruises on the Great Barrier Reef, 35 years later the fleet has grown to an all-new ocean-going fleet featuring the intimate blue-water vessel Coral Discoverer and the brand-new flagship vessels Coral Adventurer and sister ship Coral Geographer. The Coral Expeditions fleet is purpose-built for expedition cruising with features of all vessels including shallow draft allowing access to remote locations that larger vessels cannot reach.

Expansive indoor and outdoor spaces, including the much-loved Xplorer bar with 300-degree views, immerse guests in the spectacular natural surroundings and allow ample personal space and open air.  An expert expedition team including specialist guests’ lecturers provide insightful commentary and interpretation along the way. </p><p>Headquartered in Cairns, Australia, Coral Expeditions offers expedition cruises to the outer known regions of the Great Barrier Reef, the ancient Kimberley coastline, Tasmania’s wilderness coast, Cape York and Arnhem Land, New Zealand and further afield to the small Islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
